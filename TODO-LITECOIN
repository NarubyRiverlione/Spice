- src/init.cpp         "\n" + _("SSL options: (see the Litecoin Wiki for SSL setup instructions)") + "\n" +
                       Add this to Litecoin Wiki so the doc is not lying?  Just copy the relevant info from Bitcoin wiki.
- doc/release-process.txt - Rewrite for Litecoin!!!!
- Artwork
   splash.png needs rework
   splash_testnet.png missing
   about needs rework
- Investigate change behavior.  Does Litecoin currently create change outputs below 0.01?
  If so we might be better off throwing that change directly into fee.

KNOWN BUGS
==========
- Assertion Failure During Shutdown?
  litecoind: /usr/include/boost/thread/pthread/recursive_mutex.hpp:105: void boost::recursive_mutex::lock(): Assertion `!pthread_mutex_lock(&m)' failed
  gmaxwell reported seeing it often with bitcoin-0.8.2rc1, likely with his Fedora native builds.  I saw it on my Fedora native build but not gitian builds so far.
- Looping "Flushed 12035 addresses to peers.dat  38ms" messages forever after Litecoin-Qt is told to Exit.
  kill -9 required to kill it.
  Uncertain if litecoind is also affected.
