- src/init.cpp         "\n" + _("SSL options: (see the Litecoin Wiki for SSL setup instructions)") + "\n" +
                       Add this to Litecoin Wiki so the doc is not lying?  Just copy the relevant info from Bitcoin wiki.
- doc/release-process.md - Rewrite for Litecoin!!!!
- Investigate change behavior.  Does Litecoin currently create change outputs below 0.01?
  If so we might be better off throwing that change directly into fee.
